# 
# A subrepresentation is a subvector space that is also a representation of $G$ under the same action.
# 
# ```{admonition} Definition (Subrepresentation)
# :class: definition
# 
# Let $V$ be a linear representation of a group $G$. A subspace $W$ of $V$ is a subrepresentation if $W$ is invariant under $G$ - that is, if $g.w\in W$ for all $g\in G$ and all $w\in W$.
