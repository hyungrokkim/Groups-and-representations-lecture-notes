    "# Classification of representations for symmetric groups\n",
    "\n",
    "For the symmetric group $S_n$, all irreducible representations have been classified and they can be constructed using the so-called Young symmetrisers and Frobenius's formula for their characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Young diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we observe that all conjugacy classes in $S_n$ are determined by their cycle structure. All elements of a class have the same cycle structure. The cycle struscture is described by a set of non-negative integers $\\{\\nu_r\\}$, where $r=1,2,\\ldots,n$, and $\\nu_r$ is the number of $r$-cycles.\n",

The classes can be labelled by partitions of $n$ and there is as many classes as partitions of $n$. A useful way to keep track of the partitions os to introduce a pictorial notation in terms of Young diagrams. The Young diagram corresponding to the partition $\\{\\mu_r\\}$ of $n$ consists of left-justified rows of $\\mu_r$ boxes stacked in decreasing order of length.\n",

    "\n",
    "Young diagrams plat a more significant role in defining the irreducible representations of the symmetric group. There is a Young diagram for every partition of $n$, but there is also an irreducible representation of $S_n$ for every Young diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Young diagram, one produces a Young tableaux by filling the $n$ boxes of the diagram with the numbers $1$ through $n$, in such a way that the numbers always increase from left to right along each row and from top to bottom in any column.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a Young diagram place a hook pointing to the right and down in the center of each box. The hook length of the box is the number of boxes lying along the hook in both directions.\n",

    "### Young symmetriser\n",
    "\n",
    "To each Young tableau there is a symmetriser that projects out of any vector on which it acts the part belonging to the irreducible representation associated to this tableau. To construct it, we need to identify among all $n!$ permutations, those which leave the labels in their rows (denoted $R$) and those which leave the labels in the columns (denoted $C$).\n",
